KPeg
====

KPeg is a simple PEG library for Ruby. It provides an API as well as native grammar to build the grammar.

KPeg strives to provide a simple, powerful API without being too exotic.

KPeg supports direct left recursion of rules via the [OMeta memoization](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2008003_experimenting.pdf) trick.
